# Array Binary Search
Today, I'm writing a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key and returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
I can't utilize any of the built-in methods available in JavaScript.
