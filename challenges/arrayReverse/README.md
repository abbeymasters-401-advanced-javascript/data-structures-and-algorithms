# Reverse an Array
Today I wrote a function called reverseArray which takes in an array as an argument and returns an array with all of the elements in reversed order.

## Challenge
We weren't able to use any built-in methods to solve this challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used a backwards for loop to go through all of the elements and put them in a new array. This was a pretty quick approach, if we were able to use built-in methods I think I would have been able to find a shorter solution.
