# Stacks and Queues

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a Node class, a Stack class and a Queue class to build multiple push, pop, peek methods off of.
