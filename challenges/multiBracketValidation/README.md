# Multi-bracket Validation

## Challenge
Create a JavaScript function that should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:
* Round Brackets : ()
* Square Brackets : []
* Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach and Efficiency
I went a few different ways with this at first, and then ended up using a simple counter and a for loop. There are a lot of if statements, so I'm assuming this could be solved in a more elegant way, but for now I went for a brute force approach.
